# Livestreaming
The accessibility of web-based virtual reality is unparalleled in that almost any web-connected device can join the VR experience. However, a much larger audience can still be accessed on secondary streaming platforms, like YouTube and Twitch. Non-Player Character offers a "cinema track" of the full experience for its in-person performances to be projected onto the big screen that can also be shared over livestream.

For Virtual-only performances and rehearsals, we invite attendees to leave their webcams open while logging into and playing the VR experience on headset to share in-real-life (IRL) reaction shots. Attendees may also request to directly connect their own social accounts for livestreaming without giving out access to streamkeys or login credentials.

When attending a show, we recommend content-creators and/or VR streamers take the following steps: 

1. Use OBS or similar software to share your own web camera as a "virtual camera." This allows you to record your full screen video (and best audio) on your end to intercut with gameplay (when you clip out moments). 
2. Join our pre-show link and select Virtual Camera as your Video Input. 
3. At the top of our pre-show link, you may `Add Accounts` to securely type in your streamkey and credentials without us receiving any of this information. When we go live, the content will simultaneously stream to the channels any participants add.
5. The livestream will have a QR code overlay that allows viewers to access a web application on their mobile devices for voting and spawning objects during the live show. 
6. The chat will also be aggregated on our backstage portal so you can respond to fans.
7. Remember to start recording on OBS at the beginning of the show. 
8. We will record a backup of the livestream if you would like to request the RAW video, otherwise you can download from your own channel.
