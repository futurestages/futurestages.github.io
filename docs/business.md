## License & Touring
The application of XR technology, especially web-based virtual reality, allows *Non-Player Character* to be performed and experienced in a variety of modes and formats. First and foremost, *NPC* is a work of live musical theater performed with a live audience who may watch and interact with a live, singing actor in virtual reality. Previously, the show has successfully presented on-site at traditional stage/cinema venues, at pop-up events or activations in non-traditional spaces, livestreamed to a partner's video platform, and entirely virtual/remote. We are open to working with your specific audience and event needs, with a mission to introduce as many new audiences as possible to this exciting story and technology.

### How to Tour/Host the Show
While virtual performance offers an incredibly sustainable and scalable mode of storytelling and rehearsal, we've found much more emotional resonance through a hybrid, in-person experience: **Four (4) audience Participants share the "stage area" with the live performer (me) while the remaining Spectators watch the virtual world projected on a large screen or wall.** As the experience is accessible via web browser, we need only to open a link on the computer already connected to the venue's projector and plug our audio input into the venue's sound system. 

> A helpful reference for venues is the popular cult classic, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where live performers act out scenes in front of the projected movie while audiences are invited to participate, singalong, and playfully interject with the show.
