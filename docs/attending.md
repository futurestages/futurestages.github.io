## What Is *Non-Player Character*?
*Non-Player Character* is a musical theater play performed live using gaming mechanics and animations in virtual reality. Remote ticket links offer access to a multi-user virtual world where you may interact with the live performers and other attendees using your web-connected device. The show is also performed live in cinema venues, with select audience wearing vr headsets and directly interacting with the live performer in front of the movie screen. The virtual world is then projected onto the giant screen for seated spectators to watch both the performer and the projected image.

## What Equipment Do I Need?
*Non-Player Character* utilizes web-based virtual reality, also known as “social VR” or “WebXR” built upon the open-source client, [Mozilla Hubs. (You can learn more about that platform here.)](https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/welcome.html) This allows (almost) any web connected device to enter a 3D virtual environment as a multi-player experience with other attendees represented as 3D avatars. This means you do not require *any* special equipment to join our virtual experience. The experience is often broadcast onto a secondary stream for traditional viewing (movie screen, youtube, etc).

## Ticket Link
Virtual Workshops and Pop-Up Performances are announced via our Mailing List. These events are regularly free or suggested donation, currently averaging $15 across all attendees and $25+ for active participants. 

Before your showtime, you should receive an email with a **unique url** to access the live experience. You may type this url into your web connected device to access your performance between 30 and 5 minutes before showtime. 

## Box Office
We utilize the instant messaging platform, Discord, to guide and troubleshoot audiences through the onboarding process for our virtual shows. Venued performances primarily rely on the ticketing and house management of the physical theater.

## Refunds
*Non-Player Character* is primarily performed through outside festivals and institutions around the world and we adhere to any existing policies and/or code of conduct. Our virtual workshops are invite-only and specifically intended to stress-test new, experimental features of the show and therefore refunds cannot be issued. If you feel strongly about a refund, please contact us at info (at) jigsawensemble (dot) com and we will make our best effort to resolve your concern as soon as possible.
