# Welcome to Non-Player Characeter

## OnBoardXR represents a fleet of talent and tools to support accessible and emotionally resonate live experiences and events in the immersive web while developing and training the next generation of self-generative storytellers.

## Who is OnBoardXR for?
OnBoardXR is a community and showcase to educate, inspire, accelerate and empower live performing artists in the immersive web. Most of our performance prototypes are the very first time those artists have brought their creative practive into virtual reality and over 30% of our audiences report OnBoardXR as their first virtual reality or live vr experience.

Non-Player Character utilizes ['web-based virtual realiity'] working across platforms without purchasing equipment or downloading software. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile devices to explore in 2D ([see supported browsers](./hubs-create-join-rooms.html#for-2d-experience)).
