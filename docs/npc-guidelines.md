#  Participant Guidelines
*Non-Player Character* is a fictional experience that aims to address very real emotions, specifically grief and trauma. The experience also frequently hosts anonmous attendees in an online shared space. Therefore we provide these upfront warnings and guidelines for participants.

* WARNING: The performance may include flashing or strobing light projections which may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised. 
* WARNING: The virtual footage can cause some viewers to feel nauseous or dizzy. In the event of discomfort, we recommend briefly closing or averting your eyes. You may also choose to sit toward the back of the theater to be less immersed. 
* CONTENT WARNING: Tonightâ€™s performance contains adult language and themes of bereavement and depression. Viewer discretion is advised.

# Code of Conduct

## Virtual
Like any online community, we reserve the right to block or kick any user at any time, without warning, for behavior we interpret to be harassment, bullying, hate-speech, spam, predatory, divisive or disruptive. This applies to all virtual interactions, both within the *Non-Player Character* show experience and on any chat-based communications used by the crew and attendees.

## In Person
In person performances will follow any and all existing guidelines of the Venue hosting the performance. While we recognize the show is intended to promote engagement and interaction between audience members, we expect all attendees to practice good judgement and common courtesy expected at traditional theatrical events. Attendees should adhere to their pre-selected ticket tier, specifically, unless for health or safety emergencies, no Spectator guests should enter the stage area during the performance nor should any Participant guests leave the stage area during the performance. There is absolutely no scripted reason or invitation for guests to physically touch another guest or the performer during the performance. Staff reserves the right to remove any guest at any time, without warning, for behavior we interpret to be harassment, bullying, hate-speech, aggression, predatory, divisive or disruptive.

Thank you for ensuring everyone has the best possible experience at *Non-Player Character.*
