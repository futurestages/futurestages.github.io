## Technical Deck
*Non-Player Character* is an original musical designed and rehearsed in [web-based virtual reality](./attending.md#what-equipment-do-i-need.md). This means we can/have successfully performed the show for virtual audiences on their preferred web-connected device (desktop, tablet, vr headset) within a single URL. 

While virtual performance offers an incredibly sustainable and scalable mode of storytelling and rehearsal, we've found much more emotional impact through a hybrid, in-person experience: Four audience Participants share a "stage area" with the live performer while the remaining Spectators watch the virtual world projected on a large screen or wall. This is most comparable to art-house screenings like [*The Rocky Horror Picture Show Sing Alongs*](https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003711099244-0640.jpg) where the film is performed by actors simultaneously while projecting the cult classic movie including moments of audience participation. 

As the live experience is contatined with a web url, there is always the option to host remote audience members, either as "ghost" users or livestreaming the virtual camera to a 2D streaming site. 

To offer more interaction to users without VR headsets, we also have a Webapp for users to interact/vote/support the Participants throughout the story using their personal mobile device. This app also allows users to access information about the show, like a traditional paper programme. 

## Tiers of Experience
*Non-Player Character* explores and expands the limits of "Hybrid" or Location-Based Live Entertainment by offering access to multiple tiers of audience interaction. While our "core" experience is the live storytelling interactions between the Performer and Active Participants sharing both physical and virtual space, we recognize the importance and power of audience choice regarding their level of interaction and immersion, thereby also offering a Spectator, Remote and Livestream tier of joining *Non-Player Character*.

A robust internet connection is needed.|
