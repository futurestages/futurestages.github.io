## Tiers of Experience
Spectators will sit in the auditorium. The virtual world is projected in the background.   |
Audiences will be invited to use a VR headset provided to them on-site. They can experience the piece and interact with the live performer directly in the virtual world. Active participation will be encouraged through actions in the world.   |
