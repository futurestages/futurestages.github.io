## Welcome! 

**Non-Player Character** is an original musical theater piece performed live inside web-based virtual reality. The story follows a non-player character in a fictitious video game who witnesses the death of the hero character and turns to the audience for assistance processing the five stages of grief (represented as five virtual worlds). 

The show was conceived and developed by Brendan Bradley through his own OnBoardXR seasonal showcase to support live performance in new technology, with individual song workshops in the Fall of 2021 at FIVARS Festival and in March 2022 at Mozilla Festival with Bradley's performance supported by techincal direction from Michael Morran and music arrangment from Maurice Soque Jr. 

In December 2021, Non-Player Character was invited to stage a "prototype performance" at The Museum of Science's Mugar Omni Theater in Boston. The show was performed as a 15-minute "loop" for eight consecutive audiences, with four audience participants wearing virtual reality headsets while the experience was projected on the giant, domed IMAX screen. Bradley performed live in-headset and wearing a N95 mask to comply with COVID prototcols. 

A Workshop Cast Recording was released in September 2022 using a mix of recorded gameplay and studio recordings from Bradley and select participants. The first single, 'Reprogram Me' debuted on iTunes Top Soundtrack Charts and was critically celebrated by indepedent music and gaming blogs.
