## Licensing & Touring
The application of XR technology, especially web-based virtual reality, allows *Non-Player Character* to be performed and experienced in a variety of modes and formats, outlined in our [`Technical Deck`](./technical.md). First and foremost, *NPC* is a work of live musical theater performed with a live audience who may watch and interact with a live, singing actor in virtual reality. Previously, the show has successfully presented on-site at traditional stage/cinema venues, at pop-up events or activations in non-traditional spaces, livestreamed to a partner's video platform, and entirely virtual/remote. We are open to working with your specific audience and event needs, with a mission to introduce as many new audiences as possible to this exciting story and technology.

### How to Tour/Host the Show
As the experience is accessible via web browser, we need only to open a link on the computer already connected to the venue's projector and plug our audio input into the venue's sound system. Audiences have delighted in a hybrid, in-person experience where **Four (4) audience 'Participants' share the "stage area" with the live Performer while the remaining 'Spectators' watch the virtual world and characters projected on a large screen or wall.**

> A helpful reference for venues is the popular cult classic, [The Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003711099244-0640.jpg), where live Participants act out scenes in front of the projected movie while Spectators are invited to respond, singalong, and playfully interject with the show.

The show is most successful when our team has an opportunity for a tech rehearsal in the space prior to the performance(s) and we prefer to include at least three (3) team members in each performance to offer a dedicated focus on Live Performance, Virtual Stage Management, and Audio Playback. Additional team members can offer support for lighting, livestreaming and equipment management. We recommed our venue partners provide some on-site staff/representatives as docents or audience management in the event of any safety or guest services concerns.


### Livestreaming
The virtual experience can be broadcast to practically any livestreaming platform by screen sharing the POV of a user. Furthermore, we have designed a "cinema track" that can automatically move the user's POV throughout the show to *"the best seat in the house"* for each moment in the live show, like a ride at a theme park. This offers audiences all over the world the ability to watch the performance without attending a physical venue or operating any controllers. We refer to this as our 'virtual balcony ticket' and can also make this feature available to Influencers who wish to livestream their gameplay for their online audience. 

Please note, we have personally found it extremely helpful to also film/stream the live action video of the Participants reactions to intercut with the virtual livestream to remind remote viewers that the show is actually happening live. 

* We can provide/suggest equipment and methods for your livestreaming needs of *Non-Player Character.* 
* An additional license may be required for any persistent video-on-demand archive of the *full* livestream as a pre-recorded version. Please discuss with our team ahead of time.

### Music Covers & Remixes 
We welcome new artist renditions and recordings of the music from *Non-Player Character,* however the music is copyright protected and registered for detection across social platforms. To avoid copyright strikes on your channel(s) please contact us in writing prior to release so we can approve your usage (and likely help you promote it to our community).

### License the Show
Licensing fees and rental materials quoted upon application. 

*Non-Player Character* rental packages can include Music, Scripts, and Addons, such as the entire 'Show Build' as a "show-in-a-box" with all virtual Environments, Avatars, Props and Stage Cues. This would allow anyone, anywhere to peform the full show without any Techincal Development or Design. (Virtual Reality Hardware is not included in any packages.)

### How to Hire the Team
The team behind *Non-Player Character* may be contacted and commissioned either as a team or individually to build or consult on experiences similar to *Non-Player Character.*
