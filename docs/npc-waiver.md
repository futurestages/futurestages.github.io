#  Show Waiver
The following sample waiver is posted and provided for our venue partners and on-site audiences as an example of what in-person attendees may be asked to sign to participate in the virtual reality experience. 

## **PARTICIPATION WAIVER**

In consideration of being permitted by The Jigsaw Ensemble, it’s host(s), employee(s), assign(s), and it’s affiliate(s) (herein collectively referred to as the “Production”) to use the equipment of and participate in the activities of Non-Player Character now and in the future, I, the undersigned, on behalf of myself, (and if applicable) my child, ward, spouse, insurers, heirs, and/or assigns (collectively, the “Releasing Parties”) hereby agree as follows:

**Assumption of Inherent Risks and Dangers.** Releasing Parties acknowledge and agree that virtual reality technologies entail certain risks that simply cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential qualities of the activities and regardless of the care taken by Production. For example, the use of virtual reality equipment may subject the user to nausea and/or anxiety due to strobing light and/or the refresh rate of moving images. The use of virtual reality equipment obstructs the vision of Participants, which can lead to injury, even where digital warnings are present to warn Participants of approaching partitions. Further, the acts or omissions of other people attending Production’s facilities, using its equipment, and participating in its activities can also be the cause of injury and even death to a Participant. Releasing Parties hereby assert that use of the Production’s facilities and equipment and participation in the activities at Production’s Non-Player Character is voluntary and Releasing Parties knowingly assume all inherent risks of such act.

**Health and Medical Care.** Releasing Parties hereby assert they are in good health, and have (and has) no special health problems or issues. Releasing Parties hereby certify that they are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Releasing Parties authorize a licensed medical care provider to carry out any emergency medical care which may be necessary, and agree to be fully responsible for any associated costs and expenses.

**Photographs and Records.** In consideration of being permitted to use the Production facilities and equipment and to participate in its activities, Releasing Parties hereby grant to Production the irrevocable right and permission to photograph and/or record Releasing Parties and to use such photographs and recordings for all purposes, including, without limitation, advertising and promotional purposes, in any manner in any and all media now or hereafter known or discovered, in perpetuity throughout the world, without limitation, restriction, or inspection and without compensation of any kind. All Photographs and/or Recordings are exclusive to Production.

**Indemnification.** Releasing Parties voluntarily agree to release, waive, discharge, hold harmless, defend and indemnify Production from any and all claims, actions, or losses for bodily injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of services or otherwise which may arise out of my participation in Non-Player Character. Releasing Parties specifically understand they are releasing, discharging and waiving any claims or actions that I may have present or in the future for the negligent acts or other conduct by the owners, agents, officers or employees of Production.

**No Refunds.** Releasing Parties agree and understand that use of Production’s facilities and equipment, and participation in its activities, is subject to Production’s determination that Releasing Parties participation is safe, and Production’s staff or authorized agents may, in their sole discretion, determine it is unsafe for Releasing Parties to continue participating, and may remove a Releasing Party from the premises by any lawful means, without issuing any refund.

I HAVE READ THE ABOVE WAIVER AND RELEASE AND BY SIGNING IT AGREE THAT IT IS MY INTENTION TO EXEMPT AND RELIEVE PRODUCTION FROM LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR WRONGFUL DEATH CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE.
