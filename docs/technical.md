## Tiers of Experience
*Non-Player Character* explores and expands the limits of "Hybrid" or Location-Based Live Entertainment by offering access to multiple tiers of audience interaction. While our "core" experience is the live storytelling interactions between the Performer and Active Participants sharing both physical and virtual space, we recognize the importance and power of audience choice regarding their level of interaction and immersion, thereby also offering a Spectator, Remote and Livestream tier of joining *Non-Player Character*.

The virtual world is projected in the background while a Live Performer and Audience Participants interact on stage.| 
| ![image](https://github.com/futurestages/npcmusical/blob/main/img/icon-participant.png) |    **In-person in VR** <br>Select Audience Participants will be invited to use a VR headset provided to them on-site. They can experience the piece and interact with the live performer directly in the virtual world.|
| ![image](https://github.com/futurestages/npcmusical/blob/main/img/icon-remote.png) |    **Remotely with a personal VR headset** <br> Audiences who have access to their own VR headset can join the virtual world remotely and freely explore the world of the story. A robust internet connection is needed.|
| ![image](https://github.com/futurestages/npcmusical/blob/main/img/icon-livestream.png) |    **Remotely from any device watching the livestream** <br> Remote audiences can enjoy a more passive experience through the livestream. They will be able to see what is happening in the virtual world, as well as camera views from the stage.|
| ![image](https://github.com/futurestages/npcmusical/blob/main/img/icon-webapp.png) |    **Personal Mobile Device** <br>All audiences can participate in voting and interactions during the live show using a web application on their personal mobile device.|
