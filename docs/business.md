## License & Touring
The application of XR technology, especially web-based virtual reality, allows *Non-Player Character* to be performed and experienced in a variety of modes and formats. First and foremost, *NPC* is a work of live musical theater performed with a live audience who may watch and interact with a live, singing actor in virtual reality. Previously, the show has successfully presented on-site at traditional stage/cinema venues, at pop-up events or activations in non-traditional spaces, livestreamed to a partner's video platform, and entirely virtual/remote. We are open to working with your specific audience and event needs, with a mission to introduce as many new audiences as possible to this exciting story and technology.

### How to Tour/Host the Show
As the experience is accessible via web browser, we need only to open a link on the computer already connected to the venue's projector and plug our audio input into the venue's sound system. Audiences have delighted in a hybrid, in-person experience where **Four (4) audience 'Participants' share the "stage area" with the live performer while the remaining 'Spectators' watch the virtual world and characters projected on a large screen or wall.**

> A helpful reference for venues is the popular cult classic, [The Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003711099244-0640.jpg), where live performers act out scenes in front of the projected movie while audiences are invited to participate, singalong, and playfully interject with the show.
